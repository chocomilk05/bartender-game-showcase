# Project Name (Working Title)

A story-centered bartending game where the player mixes cocktails and
interacts with customers in a cozy bar setting.

The game is intentionally not competitive or fast-paced. Instead,
the player’s drink quality and choices influence the story and
their relationships with customers.
